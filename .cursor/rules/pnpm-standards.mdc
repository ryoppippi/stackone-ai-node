# pnpm Standards

## Overview

This repository uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as the package manager. pnpm is a fast, disk space efficient package manager.

## Package Management

- Use `pnpm install` instead of `npm install` to add dependencies
- Use `pnpm-lock.yaml` for lockfiles (automatically generated)
- When adding new dependencies, use: `pnpm add package@x.y.z`

## TypeScript Configuration

- TypeScript is configured via `tsconfig.json`
- Use `pnpm typecheck` to run type checking with tsgo

## Running Scripts

- Use `pnpm <script>` to execute scripts defined in package.json
- For one-off package execution, use `pnpm exec <command>` or `pnpm dlx <package>`

## Testing

- Use Vitest as the test runner with `pnpm test`
- Test files should follow the pattern `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`

## Environment Variables

- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` files
- Access environment variables via `process.env`

## Type Compatibility

- When encountering type conflicts between libraries:
  - Use type assertions carefully
  - Consider using `as any` only when necessary
  - Prefer creating proper type interfaces when possible

## Building

- For production builds, use `pnpm build` to create optimized bundles
